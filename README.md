## Hi, this is Mohamed Alalaiwat 👋

A application developer who spends his free time reading and watching youtube videos about programming.

As a developer, i enjoy refining/refactoring code untill there is no place for improvement. Most of my programming work is within the bounderies of dotnet for backend and javascript frameworks for frontend projects.
